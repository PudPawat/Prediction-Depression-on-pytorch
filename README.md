Prediction Depression on pytorch using neural networks
Hi, I am Pud. 

Here is code using neural network to predict depression by personal informations.
Neural nets is poppular tool to use in machine learning. and this code, I use pytorch for this project. 

Generally, this kind of problem is fixed by logistic regression. but using neural networks is not wildly use so this is reason why I would like to compare and prove that it's work and also can play and adjust several model to predict and get the different results

you can change to try another dataset but the input of network depends on variables in dataset (column)
